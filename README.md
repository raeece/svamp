SVAMP: Sequence Variation Analysis, Maps and Phylogeny, Bioinformatics (2014).
SVAMP is a stand-alone desktop application to visualise genomic variants (in VCF format) in the context of geographical metadata.
Users of SVAMP are able to generate phylogenetic trees and perform principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) in real time from VCF and associated metadata files.
Allele frequency map, geographical map of isolates, Tajimas D metric, SNP density, GC and variation density are also available for visualisation in real-time.
